Purpose

A lot of the work in our department is parsing and manipulating data from a variety of sources. The given example is one of our XML files that we send to Zillow for property syndication. Our goal in this test is to see how you will approach the processing of this feed. Your solution should take into the account that there will be other XML feeds that need parsing as well, so how modular/reusable you make the code is very important.

Time Considerations

This assignment is expect to take a few hours. We ask that you do not spend too much time on this solution. If you are stuck or have questions, feel free to reach out and we will answer quickly.
